# Online-Store-Product-Searcher
Searches and scrapes different online stores for a certain product. Just type in a product you want, and it searches Walmart, Costco, and Indigo for that product.

Run Main.java to start the code.
Important note: Amazon encodes it's html page in some way, meaning I can't scrape it with the method I used for the rest of the websites. As of now, the AmazonScraper does not do anything. 

As of now, this project scrapes Walmart, Costco, and Indigo.

Next Steps: Code the AmazonScraper, scrape more information such as name of product, price, etc. Build a website out of it.
